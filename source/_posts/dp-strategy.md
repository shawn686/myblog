## Quote and Summary from "Dynamic Programming for Coding interviews".

### Dynamic Programming Properties:
1. Optimal sub-structures;
2. Overlapping sub-problems.

### Strategy for DP Problems:
1. Write recursive solution
1) Define problem in terms of subproblems in a top-down manner;
2) Solve base case. The subproblems are solved by recursion, what is left is base case;
3) Add a terminating condition.
2. Memorization (Recursion + Cache, Top-Down, Optional)
3. DP (Bottom-Up)

### DP Problem Characteristics
1. Does it have Dynamic Programming Properties?
2. Are we trying to optimize something, maximizing or minimizing something or counting the total number of possible ways to do something?
